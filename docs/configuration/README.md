# Configuration
This document explains how to configure the application.

## Application settings
The application settings directory can be found in the following locations,
depending on your operating system:

- macOS and Linux: `~/.grundy` (where `~` is the path to your home directory)
- Windows: `C:\ProgramData\.grundy` (note the leading period)

#### Directories and files
- `app.grundy.ini` - Application settings
- `launchers.grundy.ini` - Game launchers settings
- `logs/` - Application logs
- `examples/` - Example and backup configuration files (these are reset each
time the application is restarted)
